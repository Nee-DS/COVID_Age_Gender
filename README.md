The mortality rate of different age groups in the states of the USA due to COVID19 from May to July has changed?

The analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides clear evidence of the toll that the novel coronavirus has taken on older Americans.
The analysis finds that states that have seen the largest share of COVID-19 deaths among people 65 and older include those that have had a disproportionate number of deaths in long-term care facilities. These states include Idaho (with 94% of deaths among those 65 and older), New Hampshire (92%), Massachusetts (90%), Rhode Island (90%), Minnesota (89%), Connecticut (89%), Pennsylvania (87%), Ohio (86%), Kentucky (84%), and Delaware (83%).
In this analysis for 11 weeks, with a 95% confidence interval we can say that the significance of a shift of the average age of 77 years for US over time, lies between 0.7 years to 10 years
